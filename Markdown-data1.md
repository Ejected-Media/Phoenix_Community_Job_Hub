Key Takeaways for Your "Downtown Strategy"
 * The "Van Buren" Advantage: You have two major data center operators (Digital Realty & NFINIT) essentially in your backyard. You could technically go home for lunch.
 * The "Airport" Sweet Spot: Honeywell and PhoenixNAP are excellent compromises. You get the scale of big industry without the 30+ minute drive to Chandler or the deep West Valley.
 * The "Reverse" Commute: While Intel is the furthest (lowest score), driving from Downtown to Chandler in the morning is significantly faster than the reverse. You are driving 65-75 MPH while the opposing lanes are parked.
